# FAQ

**Why did you create this?**

I wanted an easy windows way of querying against a very large **Korg Kross 2** manual for a synthesizer, the synethesizer has many parameters and this tool makes it easy to find out about functions etc.


**Can I work with multiple PDFs at the same time?**

In the current version you cannot work with multiple PDF files at the same time, but this can be added in the future if that is something required.


**What are some possible uses?**

You may have very large reference manuals, that are used for research or learning to use something.  With this tool you can queries these very large PDF files simply and easily without too much trouble.
